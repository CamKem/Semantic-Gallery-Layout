# Semantic HTML & CSS Gallery

This project demonstrates the correct usage of semantic HTML and CSS to create a responsive gallery layout. It is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that the content is easily accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## Features

- Semantic HTML: The HTML code uses semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` to provide meaningful structure to the content and make it more understandable for both users and search engines.

- CSS Flexbox and Grid: The layout is created using CSS Flexbox and Grid, which allows for flexible and responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

- Accessibility: The project follows accessibility best practices, such as providing alt text for images, using ARIA labels, and ensuring good color contrast.

- Responsive Design: The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries. This ensures that the gallery looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
